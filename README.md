# Bike Sales & Product Performance Analysis

## Project Overview

This Bike company (synthetic), with operations in both North America and Europe, is wanting to evaluate its overall performance from sales data in 2010 to 2014. Their data is focused on its sales order information, product offerings and costs, and customer profiles. 

This project thoroughly analyzes their company sales database to uncover critical insights that will help to increase the company's sales and profitability. 

To uncover key insights that will help drive the company's growth, the analysis of their SQL database were focused on these core objectives:

  - Understanding buying patterns by different customer demographic and regional information
  - Identifying top-performing products, product categories, and product lines
  - Analyzing sales and profitability trends over time
  - Measuring overall profitability throughout the given sales data

## Recommendations

## Limitations
- Sales data in both of the years 2010 and 2014 are incomplete, which have contributed to lower sales figures, inflated net profit margins, and innacurate year-over-year growth percentages for their preceding and/or following years
- Some of the order date data and the customer demographic data were null or blank values, and there is no reliable source of truth to fill in those blanks
